# Codec config API
A simple versioned config API using Minecraft's `Codec` system that allows automatic updates of configs.

## Usage
Add the Maven repository to the `repositories` block near the top of your `build.gradle`:
```groovy
repositories {
    // ...
    maven {
        url = uri('https://mschae23.de/git/api/packages/mschae23/maven')
    }
}
```

Add the API as a dependency:
```groovy
dependencies {
    // ...
    modImplementation "de.mschae23:codec-config-api:$project.codec_config_api_version"
    include "de.mschae23:codec-config-api:$project.codec_config_api_version"
}
```

Define the `codec_config_api_version` key in `gradle.properties` to set the version. See [the list of published
versions](https://mschae23.de/git/mschae23/-/packages/maven/de.mschae23-codec-config-api/versions). You can usually
just use the newest one, disregarding Minecraft version, because the library doesn't break often.
